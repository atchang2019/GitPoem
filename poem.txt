Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh, screaming that's nothing
What I pulled off the lot, thats stunting
Repping my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow
black and yellow
Black and yellow
black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
